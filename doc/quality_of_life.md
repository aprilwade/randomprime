# Quality of Life

These are the 5 Quality of Life categories that I've come up with and a *comprehensive* list of what they entail. Each level is a toggle, so picture the UI as 5 checkboxes all next to one another.

# Level 1 - Game Breaking
*Metroid Prime is a bad video game*

### NTSC-00
- Re-implement retro's fix for research core access soft-lock

### Post-NTSC-00
- Remove invisible wall over arboretum gate
- Remove inventory check for thermal visor in ruined courtyard
- Remove door lock in main quarry
- Remove door lock and bendenzium rock in geothermal core

### Sequence break-induced Soft-Locks
- Fix suntower deleting flaahgra item
- Fix research lab aether wall akwardness
- Fix observatory only being solvable upon first entering
- Fix observatory door lock soft-lock
- Fix mines security station soft-lock
- Fix gravity chamber grapple point not respawning after room is unloaded

### Randomizer-Induced Bugfixes
- Fix shitty room default spawn points*
    - Missile Station Mines
    - Piston Tunnel
    - Ruined Fountain
    - Landing Site (small only)
    - Chozo -> Magmoor Elevator room (small only)

# Level 2 - Cosmetic
- remove all of the "wow look at samus so happy to have this cool upgrade" cutscenes (e.g. Space Jump)
- remove all but 1 of the file select background  videos, so that during races, everyone spawns into the game at the same RTA
- remove all but 1 of the attract videos to make copying the game to your wii faster
- skip item acquisition pop-up message
- make the morph ball HUD says `X/Y` instead of just `X`
- If impact crater is skipped, go straight to credits instead of watching the escape sequence

# Level 3 - Logical
*Go Backwards*
- Main plaza door 2-ways
- power crashed frigate door from the back
- scan through research lab hydra from the back
- turn off the main quarry barrier from the back
- remove PCA locks
- remove EQ Access locks
- scan through MQB barrier from the back
- turn off MQA barrier from the back (metroid aggro trigger)
- scan through elite control from the back

# Level 4 - Minor Cutscenes
These are cutscenes which I think don't affect the game too much if removed.
- research lab aether
- temple security station
- energy core
- magmoor workstation (except for the first one so you can still FJ)
- all of the "wow look the power is on" in frigate
- life grove (the ghosts cutscene is left in because they just leave the map and never come back lmao)
- main plaza
- phendrana shorelines (just the area introduction, the ridley cutscene is left in)
- main quarry
- lava lake
- tower of light
- vault
- sun tower
- training chamber
- watery hall
- hall of the elders (just the bomb slots cutscenes are removed)
- crossway
- geothermal core
- vent shaft (the puffers hitting metal scene is left in because it doesn't work if removed)
- chozo ice temple
- phendrana canyon
- ruined courtyard
- observatory
- control tower
- research core

# Level 5 - Major Cutscenes
Includes all of the above cutscenes and...
- landing site
- hive totem
- ruined shrine
- burn dome
- sunchamber (the first 2 seconds of the death cutscene are left in to reposition the player and give pre-floaty)
- phen shorelines (ridley cutscene)
- quarantine cave
- mine security station
- elite control
- elite research
- central dynamo (keep the bomb jump out of the maze cutscene, otherwise, slow player will get left down there lmao)
- mqa (but with the timing closer to reality)
- elite quarters
- all of metroid prime (I fixed exo leaving the map without needing any compromises)
